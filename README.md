## ðŸ‘‹ About Me

Iâ€™m finishing an MS in Data Science & Analytics at Georgia State University (Dec 2025). Previously, I worked at Equifax (Kount) as a Data & Analytics intern, taking projects from raw data to usable tools.

I came to data science through math and stats, and stuck around because I enjoy the mix of thinking and building. Lately Iâ€™ve been exploring practical ways to use generative AI alongside bread-and-butter analytics.

Iâ€™ve picked up hands-on experience across prediction, recommendations, anomaly detection, NLP, and a bit of telemetry. Day-to-day, Iâ€™m most at home with Python and SQL, and Iâ€™ve used scikit-learn, XGBoost, PyTorch, TensorFlow, Snowflake, and LangChain when the job called for it.

Away from the keyboard, Iâ€™m a love playing chess online and have a rating of **2006 online (~99.7th percentile of a 200M+ active Chess.com player base)**â€”and a frequent kitchen experimenter.

Next stop: a full-time Data Scientist / ML Engineer role where useful beats flashy and shipped beats hypothetical.
