## ðŸ‘‹ About Me

Hi, Iâ€™m **Abhay Prabhakar** â€” a data scientist at the intersection of **fraud detection**, **machine learning**, and **generative AI**.

I build end-to-end systems: cleaning and unifying messy financial data, training fraud models that catch patterns humans miss, and prototyping **LLM-powered agents** to simulate fraud profiles for safer testing. I work across **Snowflake, Python, XGBoost, PyTorch, TensorFlow, LangChain**, and ship scalable, production-ready solutions.

What motivates me is research *with* impactâ€”exploring new ideas while delivering code thatâ€™s used: cutting inference latency to milliseconds, generating insights for policy teams, and deploying ML in production.

When Iâ€™m not in a notebook, Iâ€™m on a chessboardâ€”**â‰ˆ2000 online (~99.7th percentile of 200M+ Chess.com players)**. I also love tinkering with new tech and experimenting in the kitchen.

Iâ€™m pursuing an **MS in Data Science & Analytics at Georgia State University (Dec 2025)** and Iâ€™m open to collaborations around **AI/ML, risk, and data-driven product**.
