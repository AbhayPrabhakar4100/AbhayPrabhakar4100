## ðŸ‘‹ About Me

Iâ€™m **Abhay Prabhakar** â€” a data scientist / ML engineer who loves turning raw, messy data into products people actually use.

**What I do (and enjoy):**  
Ship end-to-end systems: ingest â†’ clean â†’ model â†’ serve â†’ monitor. Iâ€™ve worked across **prediction, ranking/recs, anomaly detection, NLP, time series, and telemetry**. Tools I reach for: **Python, SQL, Snowflake, scikit-learn, XGBoost, PyTorch, TensorFlow, LangChain**. I care about clarity, low latency, and strong observability.

**How I think:**  
I prototype fast, measure honestly, and simplify aggressively. I like the boring bits that make ML work in production: feature contracts, evals that donâ€™t lie, and dashboards that catch drift before pager oâ€™clock.

**Receipts (short list):**  
- Built data/ML pipelines that moved from notebook â†’ production, informing real decisions.  
- Explored **LLM-powered agents** for safe simulation/automation.  
- Internship @ **Equifax (Kount)** working on analytics that reduce risk without killing UX.

**Beyond code:**  
Iâ€™m a competitive chess nerd â€” **â‰ˆ2000 online (~99.7th percentile of 200M+ Chess.com players)** â€” and a serial tinkerer (new tech, new recipes).

Currently pursuing an **MS in Data Science & Analytics @ Georgia State University (Dec 2025)**.  
If youâ€™re building **applied AI/ML** with real users and real constraints, Iâ€™d love to chat.
