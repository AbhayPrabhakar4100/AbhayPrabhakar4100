## ðŸ‘‹ About Me

Iâ€™m currently finishing an MS in Data Science & Analytics at Georgia State University (Dec 2025). Previously, I was a Data Science Intern at Equifax (Kount), where I worked on end-to-end analytics and ML pipelines.

I came to data science through math and statisticsâ€”courses like Statistical Inference, Linear Models, and Machine Learningâ€”and I like the mix of theory and building. Lately Iâ€™ve been exploring generative AI for safe data simulation and faster prototyping.

Iâ€™ve gained practical experience through projects in prediction, recommendations, anomaly detection, NLP, and telemetry. On the tooling side, Iâ€™m most at home with Python and SQL, and Iâ€™ve used scikit-learn, XGBoost, PyTorch, TensorFlow, Snowflake, and LangChain.

Outside work, I love playing chess online (~99.7th percentile of a 200M+ active player base)â€”and am an enthusiastic kitchen experimenter.

Next stop: full-time Data Scientist / ML Engineer roles where useful beats flashy and shipped beats hypothetical.
